What is this?
=============
Gelbooru Image Grabber grabs images from the Gelbooru_
site and stores the images to the disk. Downloading images one-by-one from the
website is kinda tedious work. So, why don't we make some kind of program that
does the downloading automatically?

Just type tags to the Gelbooru Image Grabber and hit the "Download" button.
The grabber will get all the images searched with given tag and download them
to the disk.

.. _Gelbooru: http://www.gelbooru.com/

What do I need?
===============
Gelbooru Image Grabber is written in Python_. The grabber uses following
libraries.

- wxPython_ for GUI
- Twisted_ for Core Download Engine
- py2exe_ for generating windows binaries.
- UPX_ for compressing py2exe_ generated binaries.

You need to place upx.exe downloaded from UPX_ in the same directory with
setup.py script to generate your own py2exe windows binary.

.. _wxPython: http://www.wxpython.org/
.. _Twisted: http://www.twistedmatrix.com/
.. _py2exe: http://www.py2exe.org/
.. _UPX: http://upx.sourceforge.net/


How do I run?
=============

On Windows
----------
Download the executable files from the Downloads section. Extract the files in
the archive you downloaded to the location wherever you want.
After extraction, run grabber.exe. Have fun!


On Linux like environment
-------------------------
You should probably run the grabber using raw Python script,
you would have to install all the libraries. Library installation differs from
environment to environment.

Here is an example for installing required libraries under Ubuntu 11.04. Every command
should be executed with superuser privileges. (Hey, you are installing libraries and
superuser privileges do count) ::

    (If you don't have pip installed within your environment)
    # apt-get install python-setuptools
    # easy_install pip

    (Now, here we install required libraries for gelbooru-grabber)
    # pip install wxPython
    # pip install twisted



Download the tar gzipped files from the Downloads section. Extract the files in
the archive you downloaded to the location wherever you want. You should
extract the scripts to the location where you have permission to write.
After extraction, run the grabber.py script. Have fun!



The grabber does not work! Where can I report the problem?
